- Suicide is a very common subject, although [[Offred]] seems to have no intentions ~~or thoughts~~ of killing herself
	- on page 57 she says "A stocking, that's all you'd need"
		- this is clearly a strong thought about how one would go about killing themselves, even stating how easy it would be
	- even the fact that she is noticing all of these changes made in the architecture to "suicide proof" the environment implies that she is thinking about different means of suicide
- quite a bit of effort seems to be put into keeping the [[Handmaids]] for killing themselves
