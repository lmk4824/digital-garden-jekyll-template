- i have no idea who "the Marthas" are
	- servants maybe?
	- If so, are [[Cora]] and [[Rita]] Marthas?
		- that would explain their relation to [[Offred]] and [[the commander]] 



- i think that the Marthas are like house keeps and general "help"
- they are (for the most part) the ones who are in charge of the [[Handmaids|handmaid]](s) of the house
- it is not explicitly stated but I believe that [[Cora]] and [[Rita]] are the Marthas of [[Offred]]'s house
