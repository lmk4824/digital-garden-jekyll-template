# Readers Notes
- the [[Handmaids]] are kept in what is described to me as seeming almost prison like

>"they've removed anything you could [[Suicide|tie a rope to]]"
> -pg. 7

> "flowers are still allowed"
> -pg. 7

> "Where i am is not a prison but a privilege, as [[Aunt Lydia]] said"
> -pg. 8

- Is [[Rita]] [[the Commander]]'s [[Wives|wife]]?

- who are the [[Marthas]]

- tokens are like money but can only be exchanged for specific items

- [[Offred]] has a "pass"
	- what is this pass for?
		- it seems to be a form of identification card (pg. 66)

- [[Offred]]'s room is [[Suicide]] "proof"

>"It's good to have small goals that can be easily attained."
> -pg. 14

- [[Rita]] is not [[the Commander]]'s [[Wives|wife]]
	- [[the Commander]]'s [[Wives|wife]] does not speak to [[Offred]] unless absolutely necessary
	- [[Rita]] does speak to [[Offred]]

> "they aren't scarves for gown men but for children"
> -pg. 14

- the scarves are for [[Angels]]
	- are the [[Angels]] children?
		- but the [[angels]] fight in [[the war]]
- [[The Commander]]'s [[Wives|wife]] is [[Serena|Serena Joy]]

- [[The Commander]]'s driver is named [[Nick]]

> "perhaps he ([[Nick]]) is an [[Eyes incognito|Eye]]"
> -pg. 20
- what is an "[[Eyes incognito|Eye]]"

- [[Ofglen]] is [[Offred]]'s [[Handmaids travel in pairs|partner]]

- there is a [[The War|war]]?

- different designations of people have different [[Colours]]

- the guards that carry guns are not [[Guardians of the Faith]] but are specially picked [[Angels]]

- is this new [[Culture|society]] worldwide or just the united states?
	- just the us or at least just north America

- many other women had stayed in what is now [[Offred]]'s room b4 her

>"The spectacles women used to make of themselves. Oiling themselves like roast meat on a spit, and bare backs and shoulders, on the street, in public, and legs, not even stockings on them, no wonder those things used to happen. Things, the word she used when whatever it stood for was too distasteful or filthy or horrible to pass her lips. A successful life for her was one that avoided things, excluded things. Such things do not happen to nice women. And not good for the complexion, not at all, wrinkle you up like a dried apple. But we weren't supposed to care about our complexions any more, she'd forgotten that."
> -pg. 61

- a doctor wears a pistol on his shoulder

>"When I'm called I go through the doorway into the inner room. It's white, featureless, like the outer one, except for a folding screen, [[Colours|red cloth]] stretched on a frame, a gold eye painted on it, with a snake-twined sword upright beneath it, like a sort of handle. The snakes and the sword are bits of broken symbolism left over from [[the time before]]."
> -pg. 67

- see pages 68,69 [[Culture]], [[Law]], [[Unwomen]], [[Colonies]]

>"I thought it was an isolated incident, at the time."
> -pg. 72

- this is [[Offred]] talking about when her daughter was taken in a grocery store

>"i think of the others, those without"
> -pg. 74

>"But maybe boredom is erotic, when women do it, for men."
> -pg. 79

- see page 82: rape shaming, blaming the victim publicly

>"you cant expect a child to lie convincingly"
> -pg. 96

- when [[the commander]] reads from the bible, we are told what he reads from [[Offred]]'s internal monologue, nothing is quoted and anything that seems to be a quote is simply in italics, implying that she is thinking of the quote rather than hearing it, until the end when we get this:
	>""And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband," says [[the Commander]]. He lets the book fall closed."
	> -pg. 102

- **chapter 16, 106-110, the ceremony**

>"Maybe you light up in the dark, like an old-fashioned watch."
- [[Offred]] is talking about how the air was polluted and now people may be contaminated and different things that might happen to you because of it
	- this is why baby's are a rare commodity, one in four [[Offred]] tells us.
	- but this particular line is a reference to "[the radium girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls)" that used to paint the watch dials with radium paints before they knew that radium was highly radioactive
		- because they did not yet know that radium was dangerous  the women (and they were only women because it was believed that their small and delicate hands where better for the job) would treat this paint like it was any other
			- not to explain the whole case of the radium girls but i just wanted to point out that it is a good subtle reference

- [[Offred]]'s mother in an [[unwomen]]?

>"How easy it is to invent a humanity, for anyone at all. What an available temptation."
> -pg. 168

>"Nolite te bastardes carborundorum." = "Don't let the bastards grind you down.'"

- betrayal; "like being in an elevator cut loose from the top. Falling, falling, not knowing when you will hit."

>"Better never means better for everyone, ([[The Commander]]) says. It always means worse, for some."
> -pg. 244

>"people will do anything rather than admit their lives have no meaning"
> -pg. 249

>"freedom, like everything else, is relative"
> -pg. 267

>"a movie about the past is not the same as the past."
> -pg. 272

>"This is what she says, whispers, more or less. I can't remember exactly, because I had no way of writing it down. I've filled it out for her as much as I can: we didn't have much time so she just gave the outlines. Also she told me this in two sessions, we managed a second break together. I've tried to make it sound as much like her as I can. It's a way of keeping her alive."
> -pg. 282

- this all but confirms that this book is not in fact an internal monologue of [[Offred]] and is instead likely a diary of sorts
	- this dosen't change much but it could affect how we need to       interpret what she tells us
		- especial when she is speaking of herself

- the first time [[Offred]] cries in present tense is also the first time she is alone with [[Nick]]

- is pain a theme of this story?
	- page 307

>"Faith is only a word embroidered."
> -pg. 337

>"The world is full of weapons if your looking for them"
> -pg. 337
