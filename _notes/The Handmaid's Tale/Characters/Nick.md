- Nick is the [[Commanders]] driver

- [[Offred]] suspects Nick of being an "[[Eyes incognito|Eye]]"


- very in-depth description of [[Nick]] on pages 19-20
	- after finishing the book this makes sense
		- the book is a transcription of audio recordings that [[Offred]] made after all of these events took place
			- at the end of the book [[Offred]] falls in [[love]] with nick and so this is her recounting him
