- Offred is our protagonist as well as our narrator

> "the room, not my room"
> -pg. 9

- Offred does not want to call the room which she stays and keeps her belongings in her room
- perhaps because she does not feel she belongs there
- at the end of chapter eight(pg. 54) she finally calls it her room
	- she dos this after seeing [[The Commander]] at the doorway of her room and she states that he broke protocol
	- if we assume that she is writing this book in say a journal, this seeming almost accidental mislabeling could point to Offred not believing everything she tells herself and not being quite as unmovable as she presents herself to be
- she decides to continue to call it her room from now on


- it is implied that Offred is not "a true believer" in the system

> "thinking can hurt your chances, and i intend to last"
> -pg. 8

- Offred sees herself as a reward, "a bone teasing a dog" this makes her feel [[Power|powerful]], she holds this [[Power]] over the [[Guardians of the Faith|guards]], not for any leverage but simply for her own entertainment

- Offred was alive during [[The Time Before]]

>“It smells of me, in former times, when I was a mother.”
>-pg. 52

- Offred had a child? 
	- When?
	- Why doesn’t she anymore? 
		- What happened to that child?
	- Or is it all a metaphor?

- [[Luke]] and Offred were [[Love|married]] in [[The Time Before]]
	- is that who she had her child with?
	- before they were married they were having an affair

	>"though at [[The Time Before|that time]] men and women tried each other on, casually, like suits, rejecting whatever didn't fit."
	>-pg. 56

	>"We thought we had such problems. How were we to know we were happy"
	>-pg. 56

>"When I saw that, that evidence left by two people, of [[love]] or something like it, desire at least, at least touch, between two people now perhaps old or dead, I covered the bed again and lay down on it. I looked up at the blind plaster eye in the ceiling. I wanted to feel [[Luke]] lying beside me. I have them, these attacks of the past, like faintness, a wave sweeping over my head."
>-pg. 57

- "Nolite te bastards carborundorum." is carved into the floor of the darkest corner of Offred room
