- Offred is our protagonist as well as our narrator
- This is not her actual name, we are not told her true name however this is how she is referred to by the author
	>"32This name is composed of a man's first name, Fred, and a prefix denoting "belonging to," so it is like "de" in French or "von" in German, or like the suffix -son in English last names such as Williamson. Within this name is concealed another possibility: "offered," denoting a religious offering or a victim offered for sacrifice.
	>Why do we never learn the real name of the central character? I have often been asked. Because, I reply, so many people throughout history have had their names changed or have simply disappeared from view." 
	>-authors notes, xiii

- page 95 - her name

- Offred is a [[Handmaids|Handmaid]]

> "the room, not my room"
> -pg. 9

- Offred does not want to call the room which she stays and keeps her belongings in her room
- perhaps because she does not feel she belongs there
- at the end of chapter eight(pg. 54) she finally calls it her room
	- she dos this after seeing [[The Commander]] at the doorway of her room and she states that he broke protocol
	- if we assume that she is writing this book in say a journal, this seeming almost accidental mislabeling could point to Offred not believing everything she tells herself and not being quite as unmovable as she presents herself to be
- she decides to continue to call it her room from now on

- it is implied that Offred is not "a true believer" in the system

> "thinking can hurt your chances, and I intend to last"
> -pg. 8

- Offred sees herself as a reward, "a bone teasing a dog" this makes her feel [[Power|powerful]], she holds this [[Power]] over the [[Guardians of the Faith|guards]], not for any leverage but simply for her own entertainment

- Offred was alive during [[The Time Before]]

>“It smells of me, in [[The Time Before|former times]], when I was a mother.”
> -pg. 52

- Offred had a child? 
	- When?
	- Why doesn’t she anymore? 
		- What happened to that child?
			- she died when she was five - page 72
			- now offred is saying she's not dead..?
			>"Eight, she must be now. I've filled in the time I lost, I know how much there's been. They were right, it's easier, to think of her as dead. Idon't have to hope then, or make a wasted effort. Why bash your head, said [[Aunt Lydia]], against a wall? Sometimes she had a graphic way of putting things."
			> -pg. 73
	- Or is it all a metaphor?

- [[Luke]] and Offred were [[Love|married]] in [[The Time Before]]
	- is that who she had her child with?
		- probably, not directly said tho
	- before they were married they were having an affair

	>"though at [[The Time Before|that time]] men and women tried each other on, casually, like suits, rejecting whatever didn't fit."
	> -pg. 56

	>"We thought we had such problems. How were we to know we were happy"
	> -pg. 56

>"When I saw that, that evidence left by two people, of [[love]] or something like it, desire at least, at least touch, between two people now perhaps old or dead, I covered the bed again and lay down on it. I looked up at the blind plaster eye in the ceiling. I wanted to feel [[Luke]] lying beside me. I have them, these attacks of the past, like faintness, a wave sweeping over my head."
> -pg. 57

- "Nolite te bastards carborundorum." is carved into the floor of the darkest corner of Offred room
	- writing is forbidden

- Offred is very clever

- when Offred, [[Luke]] and offred's daughter(we don't know if [[Luke]] is the father) lived together, they had a cat

- Offred has had other(at least one) [[commanders]] before [[The Commander]]

>"I ought to feel hatred for this man([[The Commander]]). I know I ought to feel it, but it isn't what I do feel. What I feel is more complicated than that. Idon't know what to call it. It isn't [[love]]."

>"I go to the window and sit on the window seat, which is too narrow for comfort. There's a hard little cushion on it, with a petit-point cover: FAITH, in square print, surrounded by a wreath of lilies. FAITH is a faded blue, the leaves of the lilies a dingy green. This is a cushion once used elsewhere, worn but not enough to throw out. Somehow it's been overlooked."
> -pg. 64

- this cushion is in [[Offred]]'s room yet it is [[Colours|green and blue, not red]]

>"My nakedness is strange to me already. My body seems outdated. Did I really wear bathing suits, at the beach? I did, without thought, among men, without caring that my legs, my arms, my thighs and back were on display, could be seen. *Shameful, immodest.* I avoid looking down at my body, not so much because it's shameful or immodest but because Idon't want to see it. Idon't want to look at something that determines me so completely."
> -pg. 71

>"I cannot avoid seeing, now, the small tattoo on my ankle. Four digits and an eye, a passport in reverse. It's supposed to guarantee that I will never be able to fade, finally, into another landscape. I am too important, too scarce, for that. I am a national resource."
> -pg. 73

>"I wait. I compose myself. My self is a thing I must now compose, as one composes a speech. What I must present is a made thing, not something born."
>-pg.75

>"how ([[Serena]]) must hate me, I think"

>"I want [[Luke]] here so badly. I want to be held and told my name. I want to be valued, in ways that I am not; I want to be more than valuable. I repeat my former name, remind myself of what I once could do, how others saw me.
>I want to steal something."
> -pg 111

>"I too am a missing person."
> -pg 118

>"I believe in thought transference now, vibrations in the ether, that sort of junk."
> -pg 121
- Offred is desperate
	- her [[Love]] for [[Luke]] is making her believe in the other-worldly simply because it brings her comfort to believe that he is thinking of her and that he is not lost

>"Maybe the life I think I'm living is a paranoid delusion."
> -pg 125
- Offred is becoming less and less sure of herself and her thoughts are becoming less black and white and more a muddled gray of maybes

>"I would rather have the disapproval, I feel more worthy of it"

>"You'll have to forgive me. I'm a refugee from the past, and like other refugees I go over the customs and habits of being I've left or been forced to leave behind me, and it all seems just as quaint, from here, and I am just as obsessive about it. Like a White Russian drinking tea in Paris, marooned in the twentieth century, I wander back, try to regain those distant pathways; I become too maudlin, lose myself. Weep. Weeping is what it is, not crying. I sit in this chair and ooze like a sponge."
