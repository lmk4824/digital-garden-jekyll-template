Offred is our protagonist as well as our narrator
this is not her actual name, we are not told her true name however this is how she is referred to by the author

Offred is a [[Handmaids|Handmaid]]

it is implied that Offred is not "a true believer" in the system

> "thinking can hurt your chances, and i intend to last"
> -pg. 8

Offred sees herself as a reward, "a bone teasing a dog" this makes her feel powerful
she holds this [[Power]] over the [[Guardians of the faith|guards]], not for any leverage but simply for her own entertainment

Offred was alive during [[the time before]]

>“It smells of me, in former times, when I was a mother.”
>-pg. 52

Offred had a child? When? Why doesn’t she anymore? Or is it all a metaphor?
